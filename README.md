## What is CrewAI?
CrewAI is a lean, lightning-fast Python framework built entirely from scratchâ€”completely independent of LangChain or other agent frameworks.

CrewAI empowers developers with both high-level simplicity and precise low-level control, ideal for creating autonomous AI agents tailored to any scenario:
* **CrewAI Crews**: Optimize for autonomy and collaborative intelligence, enabling you to create AI teams where each agent has specific roles, tools, and goals.
* **CrewAI Flows**: Enable granular, event-driven control, single LLM calls for precise task orchestration and supports Crews natively.

## How Crews Work
Just like a company has departments (Sales, Engineering, Marketing) working together under leadership to achieve business goals, CrewAI helps you create an organization of AI agents with specialized roles collaborating to accomplish complex tasks.
